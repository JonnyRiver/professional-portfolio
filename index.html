        <p>
          Hello, my name is Jonathan Martin. I was born January 13th 1990 near
          Detroit, Michigan. I spent majority of my life in Michigan and have a
          lot of family there still. In 2014 my wife and I visited Charlotte,
          North Carolina and fell in love with it. We made the decision to start
          fresh and moved shortly after. After settling in, I was able to get a
          job working at Firestone Complete Auto Service. Having a passion for
          cars, I quickly moved up to become an ASE certified automotive
          technician. I have been in the automotive field for about 8 years now.
          I enjoy working on cars and learning new and upcoming automotive
          technology. Unfortunately, with the changing industry, I don't feel it
          is a good fit for me in this time of my life. So with that, I looked
          into a career in web developement. It is very exciting and challenging
          for me, which is very motivating. I am currently studying web
          developement to complete my career change.
